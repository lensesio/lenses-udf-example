# lenses-udf-example
Example for User Defined Functions for Lenses SQL engine

# Compile,Build, Package
This project is using the Maven build system. So to build you should run:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

# Lenses UDF

User-Defined Functions (aka UDF) is a feature of Lenses SQL that allows you to define
new functions that extend the existing vocabulary of Lenses SQLâ€™s DSL for manipulating data.
Many functions are already built in into Lenses SQL and over time that set is expected to grow.
However, a user might still need a function that is not covered by the default package.
Lenses provides a simple API that can be implemented to provide custom functions that go beyond the built-in ones.
